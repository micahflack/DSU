  abstract = {In the United States, the breadth of the president's warmaking authority has been governed by the Constitution, the Supreme Court's jurisprudence, and, over time, historical practice; in short, the president's powers are constrained by a well-developed body of US foreign relations law. But the prospect of a new kind of conflict -- cyberwar -- potentially challenges the existing regulatory regime, which rests on assumptions that are common to traditional, conventional war. For some, the complexities of cyberwar generate new foreign relations -- law questions about the president's authority to engage in offensive cyberoperations, and they thus necessitate a new regulatory framework. For others, cyberwar is not meaningfully different from traditional war for purposes of foreign relations law, and the extant regime regulating the president is sufficient. As it currently stands, the debate about the scope of the president's cyberwar authority turns on arguments about cyberwar's similarity or dissimilarity to conventional war. This Essay argues that any claim about regulating the president's authority to engage in cyberwar requires consideration of the United States' cyberstrategy and the capacity and national interests of the United States' cybercompetitors. For the United States to achieve its foreign policy goals in cyberspace, the president must navigate both the internal constraints from domestic law and the external constraints from international politics. Building on previous work, the Essay provides two models with which to understand internal and external constraints and their consequences on any potential cyberwar regulation. It contends that a framework that does not consider the complex relationship between the two types of constraints might result in a regulatory regime that leaves the president overconstrained and unable to achieve US cyberpolicy goals.},

  abstract = {The present paper focuses on Cyber Security Awareness Campaigns, and aims to identify key factors regarding security which may lead them to failing to appropriately change people's behaviour. Past and current efforts to improve information-security practices and promote a sustainable society have not had the desired impact. It is important therefore to critically reflect on the challenges involved in improving information-security behaviours for citizens, consumers and employees. In particular, our work considers these challenges from a Psychology perspective, as we believe that understanding how people perceive risks is critical to creating effective awareness campaigns. Changing behaviour requires more than providing information about risks and reactive behaviours -- firstly, people must be able to understand and apply the advice, and secondly, they must be motivated and willing to do so -- and the latter requires changes to attitudes and intentions. These antecedents of behaviour change are identified in several psychological models of behaviour. We review the suitability of persuasion techniques, including the widely used `fear appeals'. From this range of literature, we extract essential components for an awareness campaign as well as factors which can lead to a campaign's success or failure. Finally, we present examples of existing awareness campaigns in different cultures (the UK and Africa) and reflect on these.},

  shorttitle = {Chip and {{Skim}}},
  urldate = {2022-12-06},
  abstract = {EMV, also known as "Chip and PIN", is the leading system for card payments worldwide. It is used throughout Europe and much of Asia, and is starting to be introduced in North America too. Payment cards contain a chip so they can execute an authentication protocol. This protocol requires point-of-sale (POS) terminals or ATMs to generate a nonce, called the unpredictable number, for each transaction to ensure it is fresh. We have discovered two serious problems: a widespread implementation flaw and a deeper, more difficult to fix flaw with the EMV protocol itself. The first flaw is that some EMV implementers have merely used counters, timestamps or home-grown algorithms to supply this nonce. This exposes them to a "pre-play" attack which is indistinguishable from card cloning from the standpoint of the logs available to the card-issuing bank, and can be carried out even if it is impossible to clone a card physically. Card cloning is the very type of fraud that EMV was supposed to prevent. We describe how we detected the vulnerability, a survey methodology we developed to chart the scope of the weakness, evidence from ATM and terminal experiments in the field, and our implementation of proof-of-concept attacks. We found flaws in widely-used ATMs from the largest manufacturers. We can now explain at least some of the increasing number of frauds in which victims are refused refunds by banks which claim that EMV cards cannot be cloned and that a customer involved in a dispute must therefore be mistaken or complicit. The second problem was exposed by the above work. Independent of the random number quality, there is a protocol failure: the actual random number generated by the terminal can simply be replaced by one the attacker used earlier when capturing an authentication code from the card. This variant of the pre-play attack may be carried out by malware in an ATM or POS terminal, or by a man-in-the-middle between the terminal and the acquirer. We explore the design and implementation mistakes that enabled these flaws to evade detection until now: shortcomings of the EMV specification, of the EMV kernel certification process, of implementation testing, formal analysis, and monitoring customer complaints. Finally we discuss countermeasures. More than a year after our initial responsible disclosure of these flaws to the banks, action has only been taken to mitigate the first of them, while we have seen a likely case of the second in the wild, and the spread of ATM and POS malware is making it ever more of a threat.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter (UART) are described, which is basically a serial data transmission protocol used in digital circuit applications. The architecture of the UART transmitter has a baud rate generator, parity generator, transmitter finite state machine (FSM) and parallel in serial out register (PISO). UART receiver has a baud rate generator, negative edge detector, parity checker, receiver finite state machine (FSM) and serial in parallel out (SIPO) register. The baud rate generator of both transmitter and receiver is the same, so the baud rate of transmitter/receiver is the same. Baud rate generator is the same as the frequency divider circuit. The data frame of the UART transmitter is 1 start bit, 8 transmits data bits, 1 parity bit and 1 stop bit. The baud rate of the transmitter and receiver is 4 Mbps using the system clock of 64 MHz's. Implementation, simulation, and synthesis is done Xilinx Vivado 2016.2 version tool. The design is verified using simulated waveform and synthesized on the FPGA Zed board.},

  abstract = {Under the strong impact of the Internet, the operation of traditional shopping malls has become more and more difficult and urgently needs to be reformed. What can help the reform of shopping malls is the massive sales data generated in the long-term operation. However, because the cashier systems of merchants are independent of each other, it is difficult for shopping malls to acquire and audit the sales data reported by merchants in a unified manner. Therefore, a printer data senseless acquisition device is designed and completed. Subsequently shopping malls can use the merchant sales data acquired by the device to collect rent and optimize the types of merchants. In this paper, without affecting any function and printing process of the cash register printer, a data acquisition device is connected in series between the cash register and the printer. The device is plug and play, compatible with USB ports and serial port micro printers. For a cash register, the device is simulated as a printer; for a printer, the device is simulated as a cash register, which completes adaptive simulation (without configuration) and transparent transmission functions and can realize network data transmission or SD card temporary storage.},

  abstract = {With the widespread adoption of electronic government services, there has been a need to ensure a seamless flow of information across public sector organizations, while at the same time, maintaining confidentiality, integrity and availability. Governments have put in place various initiatives and programs including information security awareness to provide the needed understanding on how public sector employees can maintain security and privacy. Nonetheless, the implementation of such initiatives often faces a number of challenges that impede further take-up of e-government services. This paper aims to provide a better understanding of the challenges contributing towards the success of information security awareness initiatives implementation in the context of e-government. Political, organizational, social as well as technological challenges have been utilized in a conceptual framework to signify such challenges in e-government projects. An empirical case study conducted in a public sector organization in Greece was exploited in this research to reflect on these challenges. While, the results from this empirical study confirm the role of the identified challenges for the implementation of security awareness programs in e-government, it has been noticed that awareness programmers often pursue different targets of preserving security and privacy, which sometimes results in adding more complexity to the organization.},

It has been widely criticized as vague, poorly structured, and having an overly broad definition of loss that invites prosecutorial abuse. One of the problems with sentencing under the CFAA has received little attention: a misalignment between the facts that affect sentencing and the importance of those facts to the seriousness of CFAA crimes. It has been observed, for example, that CFAA sentences escalate rapidly as (easily inflated) losses increase. But this escalation may be rapid not only in an absolute sense, but in disproportion to other attributes of the crime.

  abstract = {"In 2014, the world witnessed the start of a mysterious series of cyberattacks. Targeting American utility companies, NATO, and electric grids in Eastern Europe, the strikes grew ever more brazen, including the first-ever blackouts triggered by hackers. They culminated in the summer of 2017, when the malware known as NotPetya was unleashed, penetrating, disrupting, and paralyzing some of the world's largest companies--from drug manufacturing to software to shipping. At the attack's epicenter in Ukraine, ATMs froze. The railway and postal systems shut down. Hospitals went dark. NotPetya spread around the world, inflicting an unprecedented ten billion dollars in damage--the largest, most devastating cyberattack the world had ever seen. The hackers behind these attacks are quickly gaining a reputation as the most dangerous team of cyberwarriors in history: Sandworm. Working in the service of Russia's military intelligence agency, they represent a persistent, highly skilled, state-sponsored force, one whose talents are matched by their willingness to launch broad, unrestrained attacks on the most critical infrastructure of their adversaries. They target government and private sector, military and civilians alike. A chilling, globe-spanning detective story, Sandworm considers the danger this force poses to our national stability and security. As the Kremlin's role in meddling in the 2016 election, manipulating foreign governments, and sparking chaos comes into greater focus, Sandworm exposes the realities not just of Russia's global digital offensive, but of an era where warfare ceases to be waged on the battlefield. It reveals how the line between digital and physical conflict, between wartime and peacetime, have begun to blur--with world-shaking implications"--},

Thus, while elaborating on the legal concept of cyberattacks, this research also studies the significance of this relatively new concept in the current order of international community and taking into account the main question of research on applicability of jus ad bellum principles in cyber-attacks, the research concludes that while some experts assert that these principles apply to cyber-attacks, the applicability of these principles depends upon ``type, intensity and impacts of attacks'' and that they may only be applied in cases where the severity and threshold of an armed attack have been met. Therefore, it is necessary to not only study the current principles, but also the principles required for conclusion of an international contract and such mechanisms must be established.},

In order to do that, we need to know basic details of that target board architecture and we need to be clear with the features that the target board should support. File system used here is the standard EXT2 file system and the boot loader used here is ``UBOOT'' replacing the ``GRUB''. Once we have made the platform ready for the working of our driver coding, we need to build the driver coding that runs on the target platform. In this case, it is driver for LED and UART. Then we need some tools that generate equivalent code for target architecture. For that, we go for cross-compilers such as Tool chain which consists of assembler, linker, compiler, debugger, etc. This paper projects the implementation of serial communication between a PC and an ARM. Hence, there must be some customization to reduce size of kernel and then a memory management technique of ring buffer is implemented.},

  abstract = {The security of capacitive touchscreens is crucial since they have become the primary human-machine interface on smart devices. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents WIGHT, the first wired attack that creates ghost touches on capacitive touchscreens via charging cables, and can manipulate the victim devices with undesired consequences, e.g., allowing malicious Bluetooth connections, accepting files with viruses, etc. Our study calls for attention to a new threat vector against touchscreens that only requires connecting to a malicious charging port, which could be a public charging station, and is effective across various power adapters and even USB data blockers. Despite the fact that smartphones employ abundant noise reduction and voltage management techniques, we manage to inject carefully crafted signals that can induce ghost touches within a chosen range. The underlying principle is to inject common-mode noises over the power line to avoid being effectively filtered yet affect the touch measurement mechanism, and synchronize the malicious noise with the screen measurement scanning cycles to place the ghost touches at target locations. We achieve three types of attacks: injection attacks that create ghost touches without users touching the screen, alteration attacks that change the detected legitimate touch position, and Denial-of-Service attacks that prevent the device from identifying legitimate touches. Our evaluation on 6 smartphones, 1 tablet, 2 standalone touchscreen panels, 6 power adapters, and 13 charging cables demonstrates the feasibility of all three type attacks.},

  abstract = {The security of capacitive touchscreens is crucial since they have become the primary human-machine interface on smart devices. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents WIGHT, the first wired attack that creates ghost touches on capacitive touchscreens via charging cables, and can manipulate the victim devices with undesired consequences, e.g., allowing malicious Bluetooth connections, accepting files with viruses, etc. Our study calls for attention to a new threat vector against touchscreens that only requires connecting to a malicious charging port, which could be a public charging station, and is effective across various power adapters and even USB data blockers. Despite the fact that smartphones employ abundant noise reduction and voltage management techniques, we manage to inject carefully crafted signals that can induce ghost touches within a chosen range. The underlying principle is to inject common-mode noises over the power line to avoid being effectively filtered yet affect the touch measurement mechanism, and synchronize the malicious noise with the screen measurement scanning cycles to place the ghost touches at target locations. We achieve three types of attacks: injection attacks that create ghost touches without users touching the screen, alteration attacks that change the detected legitimate touch position, and Denial-of-Service attacks that prevent the device from identifying legitimate touches. Our evaluation on 6 smartphones, 1 tablet, 2 standalone touchscreen panels, 6 power adapters, and 13 charging cables demonstrates the feasibility of all three type attacks.},

  journal = {Electronic Frontier Foundation},
  urldate = {2022-09-23},
  abstract = {Last Updated October 2014.~~ By Hanni Fakhoury and~Dia Kayyali Your computer, phone, and other digital devices hold vast amounts of personal information about you and your family. This sensitive data is worth protecting from prying eyes, including those of the government. The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects you from unreasonable government searches and seizures, and this protection extends to your computer and portable devices. But how does this work in the real world? What should you do if the police or other law enforcement officers show up at your door and want to search your computer? EFF has designed this guide to help you understand your rights if officers try to search the data stored on your computer or portable electronic device, or seize it for further examination somewhere else. Keep in mind that the Fourth Amendment is the minimum standard, and your specific state may have stronger protections. Because anything you say can be used against you in a criminal or civil case, before speaking to any law enforcement official, you should consult with an attorney. Remember{\quotesinglbase} generally the fact that you assert your rights cannot legally be used against you in court. You can always state: "I do not want to talk to you or answer any questions without my attorney present." If they continue to ask you questions after that point, you can say: "Please don't ask me any further questions until my attorney is present." And if the police violate your rights and conduct an illegal search, often the evidence they obtain as a result of that search can't be used against you. We've organized this guide into three sections: Overview: When can the police search my devices? The police have a warrant. Now what? The police can't get in to my computer. Now what? Overview: When can the police search my devices? If you consent to a search, the police don't need a warrant. Law enforcement may show up at your door. Apart from a few exceptions, police need a warrant to enter your home. Be aware that the police can ask your roommate/guest/spouse/partner for access to your computer if they don't have a warrant. Even if you're arrested, police can only search your phone under limited circumstances. Police can search your computer or portable devices at the border without a warrant. If you consent to a search, the police don't need a warrant. The most frequent way police are able to search is by asking you for permission. If you say ``yes'' and consent to the search, then police don't need a warrant. You can limit the scope of that consent and even revoke or take it back after the officers begin searching, but by then it may be too late.1 That's why it's better not consent to a search--police may drop the matter. If not, then they will generally need to get a search warrant to search. Law enforcement may show up at your door. Apart from a few exceptions, police need a warrant to enter your home. The police can't simply enter your home to search it or any electronic device inside, like a laptop or cell phone, without a warrant. When the police knock on your door, you do not have to let them in unless they have in their possession and show you a valid search warrant. The safest thing to do is step outside and shut the door behind you. They may or may not indicate right away why they are there. If they have a warrant, ask to see it. If they offer to simply ``interview'' you, it is better to decline to speak until your attorney can be present. You can do this by telling the officer: ``I do not want to talk to you. I do not consent to a search. I want to speak to my attorney.'' There are two major exceptions to the warrant requirement. First, if you consent to a search, then the police can search within the scope of your consent.2 That's why it is usually better to not consent to a search. Second, if police have probable cause to believe there is incriminating evidence in the house or on an electronic device that is under immediate threat of destruction, they can immediately search it without a warrant.3 Be aware that the police can ask your roommate/guest/spouse/partner for access to your computer if they don't have a warrant. The rules around who can consent to a search are fuzzy. The key is who has control over an item. Anyone can consent to a search as long as the officers reasonably believe the third person has control over the thing to be searched.4 However, the police cannot search if one person with control (for example a spouse) consents, but another individual (the other spouse) with control explicitly refuses.5 It's unclear, however, whether this rule applies to items like a hard drive placed into someone else's computer.6 And even where two people have control over an item or place, police can remove the non-consenting person and return to get the other's consent to search.7 You may want to share this know your rights guide with everyone in your home and ask them not to consent to a search by law enforcement. Even if you're arrested, police can only search your phone under limited circumstances. After a person has been arrested, the police generally may search the items on her person and in her pockets, as well as anything within her immediate control, automatically and without a warrant. But the Supreme Court has ruled that police cannot search the data on a cell phone under this warrant exception.8 Police can, however, search the physical aspects of the phone (like removing the phone from its case or removing the battery) and in situations where they actually believe evidence on the phone is likely to be immediately destroyed, police can search the cell phone without a warrant. Police can search your computer or portable devices at the border without a warrant. Fourth Amendment protection is not as strong at the border as it is in your home or office.9 This means that law enforcement can inspect your computer or electronic equipment, even if they have no reason to suspect there is anything illegal on it.10 An international airport, even if many miles from the actual border, is considered the functional equivalent of a border.11 However, border officials in Alaska, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Northern Mariana Islands, Oregon and Washington can only confiscate an electronic device and conduct a more thorough ``forensic'' examination of it if they have reasonable suspicion you've engaged in criminal behavior.12 The police have a warrant. Now what? Ask to see the warrant. The warrant limits what the police can do. Although the warrant limits what the police can look for, if they see something illegal while executing a warrant they can take it. If the police want to search your computer, it doesn't matter whether you're the subject of their investigation. You do not have to assist law enforcement when they are conducting their search. You do not have to answer questions while law enforcement is searching. Ask to see the warrant. A warrant is a document signed by a judge giving the police permission to either arrest you or search your property and take certain items from that property. You have the right to see the warrant and should check to make sure it is valid. A warrant should contain: The correct name of the person arrested or the correct address of the specific place to be searched; A list of the items that can be seized or taken by the police; The judge's signature; A deadline for when the arrest or search must take place The police must take the warrant with them when executing it and give you a copy of it.13 They must also knock and announce their entry before they try to forcefully enter your home,14 and must serve the warrant during the day in most circumstances.15 The warrant limits what the police can do. The purpose of the warrant is to give the judge, not the police, the discretion to decide what places can be searched and which items can be taken.16 That's why a warrant is supposed to state exactly what the police can search and seize.17 However, if the warrant authorizes the police to search for evidence of a particular crime, and such evidence is likely to be found on your computer, some courts have allowed the police to search the computer without a warrant.18 And remember, if you consent to a search, it doesn't matter if the police have a warrant; any search is permissible as long as the search is consistent with the scope of your consent. Although the warrant limits what the police can look for, if they see something illegal while executing a warrant they can take it. While the police are searching your home, if they observe something in "plain view" that is suspicious or incriminating, they may take it for further examination and can rely on their observation to later get a search warrant.19 For example, if police see an open laptop with something obviously illegal on the screen, they could seize that laptop. If the police want to search your computer, it doesn't matter whether you're the subject of their investigation. It typically doesn't matter whether the police are investigating you, or think there is evidence they want to use against someone else located on your computer. If they have a warrant, if you consent to the search, or they think there is something incriminating on your computer that may be immediately destroyed, the police can search it. But remember, regardless of whether you're the subject of an investigation, you can always seek the assistance of the lawyer. You do not have to assist law enforcement when they are conducting their search. You do not have to help the police conduct the search. But you should not physically interfere with them, obstruct the search or try to destroy evidence, since that can lead to your arrest. This is true even if the police don't have a warrant and you do not consent to the search, but the police insist on searching anyway. In that instance, do not interfere but write down the names and badge numbers of the officers and immediately call a lawyer. You do not have to answer questions while law enforcement is searching. You do not have to answer any questions. In fact, because anything you say can be used against you and other individuals, it is best to say nothing at all other than ``I do not want to talk to you. I do not consent to a search. I want to speak to my attorney.'' However, if you do decide to answer questions, be sure to tell the truth. In many contexts, it is a crime to lie to a police officer and you may find yourself in more trouble for lying to law enforcement than for whatever it was on your computer they wanted.20 The police can't get in to my computer. Now what? The police can take your computer with them and search it somewhere else. You do not have to hand over your encryption keys or passwords to law enforcement. You may be able to get your computer back if it is taken and searched. There is less protection against a search at a place of employment. The police can take your computer with them and search it somewhere else. As long as the police have a warrant, they can seize the computer and take it somewhere else to search it more thoroughly. As part of that inspection, the police may make a copy of media or other files stored on your computer.21 You do not have to hand over your encryption keys or passwords to law enforcement. The Fifth Amendment protects you from being forced to give the government self-incriminating testimony. Courts have generally accepted that telling the government a password or encryption key is ``testimony.'' A police officer cannot force or threaten you into giving up your password or unlocking your electronic devices. However, a judge or a grand jury may be able to force you to decrypt your devices in some circumstances. Because this is a legally complicated issue, if you find yourself in a situation where the police, a judge or grand jury are demanding you turn over encryption keys or passwords, you should let EFF know right away and seek legal help. You may be able to get your computer back if it is taken and searched. If your computer was illegally taken, then you can file a motion with the court to have it returned.22 If the police believe that evidence of a crime has been found on your computer (such as possessing ``digital contraband'' like pirated music and movies, or digital images of child pornography), the police can keep the computer as evidence. They may also attempt to keep the computer permanently, a legal process known as forfeiture, but you can challenge forfeiture in court.23 There is less protection against a search at a place of employment. Generally, you have some Fourth Amendment protection in your office or workspace.24 This means the police need a warrant to search your office and work computer unless one of the exceptions described above apply. But the extent of Fourth Amendment protection depends on the physical details of your work environment, as well as any employer policies. For example, the police will have difficulty justifying a warrantless search of a private office with doors and a lock and a private computer that you have exclusive access to. On the other hand, if you share a computer with other co-workers, you will have a weaker expectation of privacy in that computer, and thus less Fourth Amendment protection.25 However, be aware that your employer can consent to a police request to search an office or workspace in your absence.26 Plus, if you work for a public entity or government agency, no warrant is required to search your computer or office as long as the search is for a non-investigative, work-related matter.27 Want to learn more about how to protect yourself from unreasonable government searches and surveillance on your computer or portable electronic devices?

  abstract = {The U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") broadly defines computer crime--also known as cybercrime--as crime that "uses or targets computer networks. While the term computer crime includes traditional crimes, such as fraud or theft committed with the use of a computer, it also encompasses unique criminal behaviors such as hacking. To combat these crimes, prosecutors rely on technology-specific federal legislation, such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as well as the application of traditional law to activities in cyberspace, such as proscriptions against narcotics trafficking and theft. Though cybercrime is prosecuted at the state and federal level, its frequency is difficult to measure. Many never learn that they were the victim of a cybercrime, and commercial entities and institutions that do learn of an intrusion are often reluctant to report the event due to fear of negative publicity, reduced consumer trust, and increased regulatory scrutiny. Such disincentives to reporting cybercrime, coupled with the difficulty of detecting it and the dual systems of state and federal prosecution, make calculating the total damage and frequency of computer crime challenging.},

In this work, we extended BadUSB to support the new USB Type-C features and proposed a multi-mode attack model, BADUSB-C. This obtains UI status to make attacks more precise and effective. To the best of our knowledge, BADUSB-C is the first attack model utilizing USB Type-C. To validate the usability and effectiveness, we conducted extensive experiments to simulate daily usage and summarized the private information collected.

  abstract = {This article examines how the existing law of armed conflict may be applied or adapted to meet the challenges posed by cyber-attacks. It begins with a definition of cyber-attacks, cyberexploitation and cyberespionage and their differences. The article discusses how cyber-attacks are regulated by the existing body of laws such as the United Nations Charter, International humanitarian Law (IHL), international treaties and domestic laws. It notes that the existing law addresses only a small fraction of potential cyber-attacks. IHL, for example, provides a useful framework for a very small number of cyber-attack that amounts to an armed attack or that take place within the context of armed conflict. The article concludes that, since cyber-attacks are global in nature, there is need for a new international legal framework to more effectively deal with the challenges posed by cyber-attacks.},

  abstract = {The paper motivates, presents, demonstrates in use, and evaluates a methodology for conducting design science (DS) research in information systems (IS). DS is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several researchers have pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the past 15 years, little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisfies the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.},

  abstract = {In industrial control systems (ICS), programmable logic controllers (PLC) are the embedded devices that directly control and monitor critical industrial infrastructure processes such as nuclear plants and power grid stations. Cyberattacks often target PLCs to sabotage a physical process. A memory forensic analysis of a suspect PLC can answer questions about an attack, including compromised firmware and manipulation of PLC control logic code and I/O devices. Given physical access to a PLC, collecting forensic information from the PLC memory at the hardware-level is risky and challenging. It may cause the PLC to crash or hang since PLCs have proprietary, legacy hardware with heterogeneous architecture. This paper addresses this research problem and proposes a novel JTAG (Joint Test Action Group)-based framework, Kyros, for reliable PLC memory acquisition. Kyros systematically creates a JTAG profile of a PLC through hardware assessment, JTAG pins identification, memory map creation, and optimizing acquisition parameters. It also facilitates the community of interest (such as ICS owners, operators, and vendors) to develop the JTAG profiles of PLCs. Further, we present a case study of Kyros implementation over Allen-Bradley 1756-A10/B to help understand the framework's application on a real-world PLC used in industry settings. The sample PLC memory dumps are shared with the research community to facilitate further research.},

In this paper, 9 RTOSes targeting smaller processors have been evaluated and four of the RTOSes have been selected for performance benchmarking on the same M16/62P microcontroller platform to avoid bias. Based on the comparison, the {$\mu$}TKernel RTOS is chosen for porting to the H8S/2377 16-bit microcontroller to demonstrate the ease of RTOS platform migration. The same version of {$\mu$}TKernel RTOS running on different platforms are then compared. Lastly, an application is developed with the RTOS to demonstrate the ease of multi-task application development on such microcontroller platform.},

All electronic components are encapsulated in mold to protect internal structure of external damages compound. The automatic decapsulation system takes an integrated circuit encapsulated in mold compound and removes it using a user-specified chemical solution.  The main objective of this processing at automotive industry consists in detect and seen semiconductor failure analysis. In the automatic decap user can modify the etch parameters (etching temperature, etching time, acid mixture{\dots}) depending sample measures and material composition.  The target of this project is to make experimental tests with different electronic components to create an optimal decapsulation handbook, for in the future only seeing the component user will be able to select the correct etching program, and study the effect of acids over bonding wires(connections between chip surfaces and terminals in a component) when the material used as copper.  During the study engineer will understand semiconductors materials fabrication, internal packaging structure, chemicals usage for decapsulation and rinse, safety operations in the laboratory and analysis techniques.  Trial and error method will be used to establish the best etching conditions. A total of 10 decapsulation programs are created for different electronic components (integrated circuits and transistors) during this project.  For the study of acids effects in copper material, the automatic decapsulation machine presents, Bias Voltage (method create to protect copper).

  abstract = {Near Field Communication (NFC) has experienced rapid development in recent years. It is used in several applications, such as electronic payment, key management, ticketing (transport, entertainment), information reading (transport, stores, medicine), access control, electronic business cards, etc. However, the use of this technology poses security problems, especially for contactless-NFC banking transactions with an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) or a Point of Sale (PoS) machine. In this paper, we first present the most known attacks related to NFC banking transactions and then discuss the main solutions recently proposed to secure NFC banking transactions.},

However, real transaction records that can facilitate the development of effective predictive models for fraud detection are difficult to obtain, mainly because of issues related to confidentially of customer information. In this paper, we apply a total of 13 statistical and machine learning models for payment card fraud detection using both publicly available and real transaction records. The results from both original features and aggregated features are analyzed and compared. A statistical hypothesis test is conducted to evaluate whether the aggregated features identified by a genetic algorithm can offer a better discriminative power, as compared with the original features, in fraud detection. The outcomes positively ascertain the effectiveness of using aggregated features for undertaking real-world payment card fraud detection problems.},

The proposed SWD design requires only one pin and can be integrated into severely pin-limited ICs, where only a few package pins are available for debugging. This reduction in pin count has advantages in terms of miniaturization and packaging cost reduction. SWD can be used to debug and trace functionality on ARM7 and ARM9 class of processor cores from ARM Ltd. using JTAG in-circuit emulators.},

Acknowledging that the very notion of peace and security has become more complex, the volume seek to determine which questions of cybersecurity are indeed of relevance for international peace and security and which, while requiring international attention, are simply issues of contemporary governance or development. The Handbook offers a variety of thematic, regional and disciplinary perspectives on the question of international cybersecurity, and the chapters contextualize cybersecurity in the broader contestation over the world order, international law, conflict, human rights, governance and development. The volume is split into four thematic sections: Concepts and frameworks; Challenges to secure and peaceful cyberspace; National and regional perspectives on cybersecurity; Global approaches to cybersecurity. This book will be of much interest to students of cyber-security, computer science, sociology, international law, defence studies and International Relations in general"--},

This is a new and dreadful threat for any organization. Current countermeasures either require special USB devices or ask the user to decide if the device can be used. We propose a new approach that, before allowing the device to be used, forces the user to interact with it physically, to ensure that a real human-interface device is attached. Our implementation is hardware-based and, hence, can be used with any host, comprising embedded devices, and also during boot, i.e., before any operating system is running. Our approach does not require any special feature from USB devices.},

  abstract = {In 1996 and 1998 several devastating floods occurred on the Yangtze, Yellow, Haihe and Songhua Rivers in China. Flood disasters are now happening more frequently than in the past, due to the fact that economic development is changing the river discharge and the flood control system has not matched the change. In recent years it has been found that small floods cause high stage and extreme damage on the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers, which is due to the non-integrated water and sediment management. On the Yellow River a flood in 1996 with a return period of two years caused the highest recorded stage in history and resulted in huge economic losses because the high rate of siltation and the increasing water diversion from the river had greatly reduced the flood discharge capacity of the river channel. In the Haihe River basin a 1-in-50-year flood in 1996 claimed fewer lives and less damage than in earlier times thanks to artificial drainage canals built in the 1960s and 1970s, which increased the capacity of the drainage system tenfold. New problems arise, however, because due to sediment carried by the tidal current from the sea, the channel outlets are congesting. On the Yangtze River an extreme flood occurred in 1998 which resulted in serious flood damage and affected 8 million people. It was primarily a result of abnormal heavy rainfall, but the flood stage was extremely high due to a reduced flood diversion, reduced regulation capacity of riparian lakes, and channel sedimentation. This paper describes recent flood events and discusses new strategies for flood control.},

To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents WIGHT, the first wired attack that creates ghost touches on capacitive touchscreens via charging cables, and can manipulate the victim devices with undesired consequences, e.g., allowing malicious Bluetooth connections, accepting files with viruses, etc. Our study calls for attention to a new threat vector against touchscreens that only requires connecting to a malicious charging port, which could be a public charging station, and is effective across various power adapters and even USB data blockers. Despite the fact that smartphones employ abundant noise reduction and voltage management techniques, we manage to inject carefully crafted signals that can induce ghost touches within a chosen range. The underlying principle is to inject common-mode noises over the power line to avoid being effectively filtered yet affect the touch measurement mechanism, and synchronize the malicious noise with the screen measurement scanning cycles to place the ghost touches at target locations. We achieve three types of attacks: injection attacks that create ghost touches without users touching the screen, alteration attacks that change the detected legitimate touch position, and Denial-of-Service attacks that prevent the device from identifying legitimate touches. Our evaluation on 6 smartphones, 1 tablet, 2 standalone touchscreen panels, 6 power adapters, and 13 charging cables demonstrates the feasibility of all three type attacks.},
