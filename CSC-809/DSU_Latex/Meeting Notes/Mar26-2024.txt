Dissertation Meeting Notes
    + Reduce scope of Q3
    + Correct the methodology diagram
        - Bullet points answering each block
    + Make introduction less technical
        - add background section explaining the problem
        - explain USB standard, why there is threat room
    + Add chapter 5 (?)
        - Implementation / Validation / Expected Results

Breakdown and explain each bit of the timeline more, should show that each part is feasible within the designated time limit. (Disassembly should have more time).

Maybe include an implementation diagram.

Talk to Brianna about diss credits.
