Securing supply chains for critical infrastructure and any production environment is a growing concern. Third-parties or nation state level attackers have been shown to target employees or infrastructure indirectly to gain access to their target's network. One of the devices being examined to aid this research is the SNBC BTP-S80, a USB/serial connected thermal printer. These devices are made with foreign software and hardware, and they are used off the shelf without any security review. In some instances, the devices implement an MPU/MCU and an FPGA for I/O processing, which creates a potential gap for data to be modified. The proposed research aims to assess these devices for any risks and demonstrate that they could be used as a part of supply chain attacks.
