There has been a large increase of credit card fraud over the past decade, and the trend continues to grow. In order to combat this increase in cyber financial crime, it is important that we place greater focus on the end point devices used not just for payment processing but other industries as well. By assessing the peripheral devices used by the host we can improve the overall security posture of these environments before cyber criminals can expand their threat surface. In this paper, we discuss a baseline for serial print device hardware and software. We also demonstrate that there are existing hardware misconfigurations (e.g, disabled code read protection) that would allow attackers to repurpose these devices for malicious purposes; for example, the could modify and reflash the existing firmware. Although, the topic is not discussed here, there are greater implications for the device supply chains.
