  abstract = {Payment card fraud is a growing problem in the United States. Credit and debit card numbers are harvested from automated devices such as fuel dispensers, Point of Sale (POS) terminals, and Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) in a process known as "skimming". Skimming requires the installation of malicious hardware on (or inside of) the targeted device. As such, it serves as an example of a physical cyber threat. In this paper, we provide an overview of payment card skimming in general, before narrowing our focus to payment card skimming occurring at fuel pumps. We then reverse engineer skimmers which law enforcement has harvested from fuel pumps in Florida. We consider only those skimmers which use Bluetooth to exfiltrate the "skimmed" payment card data. The goals of our research are to analyze the internal operation of the skimmers and determine if they can be disabled wirelessly, without requiring the fuel pump cabinet to be opened.},

  abstract = {From the early stages of cards’ existence, a certain class of humans tried and unfortunately succeeded to commit frauds with this electronic payment instrument. The fraud with cards is a “disease” that affects the banking systems internationally, shaking the trust in this payment instrument and in the issuing banks. The paper starts with a short revision of the card typology and of the associated services that arise in time as an effect of the banks’ desire to acquire more and more clients. The recent pandemic offered a perfect motivation for banks to diversify their online platforms and services that can be used only if you have a card to perform online payments. Internet payments, so common today, increased the number of methods to do frauds with card payments and transactions, growing up the level of this type of financial criminality. The aim of this paper consists of reviewing the economic literature related to the methods old and new through which frauds with cards are committed in our days. Also, we highlight the methods that are used to prevent this type of frauds, and we reveal which are efficient in the fight against this scourge. We also analyze the evolution of frauds with cards at the international level. We find that the increasing card usage during the last years has led to a rise of the card scams. Finally, we discuss the measures required to prevent and mitigate the card fraud magnitude and policy implications.},

Unfortunately, their design has been extremely error prone. Most of the protocols found in the literature contain redundancies or security flaws. A simple logic has allowed us to describe the beliefs of trustworthy parties involved in authentication protocols and the evolution of these beliefs as a consequence of communication. We have been able to explain a variety of authentication protocols formally, to discover subtleties and errors in them, and to suggest improvements. In this paper we present the logic and then give the results of our analysis of four published protocols, chosen either because of their practical importance or because they serve to illustrate our method.},

The model has been trained on a massive corpus of text data, enabling it to provide quick and accurate responses to a wide range of user queries. However, while ChatGPT has shown impressive capabilities in many areas, it also has its limitations. One of the main challenges with the model is its tendency to produce biased or inappropriate responses based on the input it has been trained on. Additionally, the model’s reliance on statistical patterns in text data means that it may struggle with more nuanced or complex language tasks. Despite these limitations, ChatGPT represents a significant step forward in the development of conversational AI, and its potential applications are vast, from chatbots and customer service to content creation and education. As the technology continues to evolve, we will likely see even more sophisticated language models emerge, with even greater capabilities and fewer limitations.},

  abstract = {For the past two decades, the security community has been fighting malicious programs for Windows-based operating systems. However, the recent surge in adoption of embedded devices and the IoT revolution are rapidly changing the malware landscape. Embedded devices are profoundly different than traditional personal computers. In fact, while personal computers run predominantly on x86-flavored architectures, embedded systems rely on a variety of different architectures. In turn, this aspect causes a large number of these systems to run some variants of the Linux operating system, pushing malicious actors to give birth to "Linux malware." To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no comprehensive study attempting to characterize, analyze, and understand Linux malware. The majority of resources on the topic are available as sparse reports often published as blog posts, while the few systematic studies focused on the analysis of specific families of malware (e.g., the Mirai botnet) mainly by looking at their network-level behavior, thus leaving the main challenges of analyzing Linux malware unaddressed. This work constitutes the first step towards filling this gap. After a systematic exploration of the challenges involved in the process, we present the design and implementation details of the first malware analysis pipeline specifically tailored for Linux malware. We then present the results of the first large-scale measurement study conducted on 10,548 malware samples (collected over a time frame of one year) documenting detailed statistics and insights that can help directing future work in the area.},

  abstract = {Today retail businesses expect to bring the utmost in sales and payment transactions by adapting new technologies. Therefore, Advanced Point of Sales (PoS) Systems are widely used in the industry. Regardless of how efficient and secure these systems or applications work, unexpected information security risks can arise. Such risks could be a threat to their business and organization. It is important to ensure that critical information such as payment card information, handled in PoS systems is kept secure from attacks that could bring financial loss. This research provides a solution by studying the overall infrastructure of a PoS System and identifies the key events that such data would be at risk. The major concern of it was to enhance the existing security features of the system to avoid any type of malicious activity. This research consists of four main sections under security related to PoS Systems that would address the risk; Studying of malware and classifying them, detecting possible attacks and means of preventing it, a robot (BOT) to predict and generate the system status with a Data Leakage Prevention(DLP) solution for all the events occurring at a PoS. The key objective of implementing this solution was to protect the confidential data that is being used in the PoS System and to avoid threats that lead to the unavailability of the system. The implemented security features using machine learning and Deep Learning methods to the existing PoS functions produced a 99.3\% of accuracy in Malware Detection and 95\% of accuracy in its Classification process while the DLP Solution was able to obtain an accuracy of 84.6\%. The above results retrieved fulfilled the research objectives and aided to integrate an enhanced security solution for a PoS system.},

Credit and debit card fraud has changed significantly over the past few years. Gone are the days when fraudsters used simple skimming techniques – with pinhole cameras to record the associated PIN – at the ATM to harvest card credentials for card cloning. Today's fraudsters harvest card credentials – and allied information – on a commodity basis, using a variety of techniques.},

This is a new and dreadful threat for any organization. Current countermeasures either require special USB devices or ask the user to decide if the device can be used. We propose a new approach that, before allowing the device to be used, forces the user to interact with it physically, to ensure that a real human-interface device is attached. Our implementation is hardware-based and, hence, can be used with any host, comprising embedded devices, and also during boot, i.e., before any operating system is running. Our approach does not require any special feature from USB devices.},

It has to perform critical tasks on priority basis keeping the context switching time minimum. It is often associated with few misconceptions \& we have tried to throw some light on it. Since last 20 years, RTOS is undergoing continuous evolution and has resulted into development of many commercial RTOS products. We have selected few commercial RTOS of different categories of real-time applications and have discussed its real-time features. A comparison of the commercial RTOSs' is presented. We conclude by discussing the results of the survey and comparing the RTOS based on performance parameters.},

Faced with increasing security threats, new security standards requiring encryption for card data storage and transmission were introduced making harvesting card data more difficult. Encryption can be circumvented by extracting unencrypted card data from the volatile memory of POS systems. One scenario investigated in this empirical study is the introspection-based memory scraping attack. Vulnerability of nine commercial POS applications running on a virtual machine was assessed with a novel tool, which exploited the virtual machine state introspection capabilities supported by modern hypervisors to automatically extract card data from the POS virtual machines. The tool efficiently extracted 100\% of the credit/debit card data from all POS applications. This is the first detailed description of an introspection-based memory scraping attack on virtualized POS systems.},

To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents WIGHT, the first wired attack that creates ghost touches on capacitive touchscreens via charging cables, and can manipulate the victim devices with undesired consequences, e.g., allowing malicious Bluetooth connections, accepting files with viruses, etc. Our study calls for attention to a new threat vector against touchscreens that only requires connecting to a malicious charging port, which could be a public charging station, and is effective across various power adapters and even USB data blockers. Despite the fact that smartphones employ abundant noise reduction and voltage management techniques, we manage to inject carefully crafted signals that can induce ghost touches within a chosen range. The underlying principle is to inject common-mode noises over the power line to avoid being effectively filtered yet affect the touch measurement mechanism, and synchronize the malicious noise with the screen measurement scanning cycles to place the ghost touches at target locations. We achieve three types of attacks: injection attacks that create ghost touches without users touching the screen, alteration attacks that change the detected legitimate touch position, and Denial-of-Service attacks that prevent the device from identifying legitimate touches. Our evaluation on 6 smartphones, 1 tablet, 2 standalone touchscreen panels, 6 power adapters, and 13 charging cables demonstrates the feasibility of all three type attacks.},

Due to the trust-by-default characteristics, USB security has caused severe problems. For example, a well-known firmware attack, BadUSB, performs malicious operations on the victim hosts through disguising ordinary USB devices as human interface devices like keyboards and mice. However, BadUSB suffers from several limitations. Attackers cannot obtain the status of User Interface (UI) to conduct precise attacks and get the visual feedback of their attacks. In this work, we extended BadUSB to support the new USB Type-C features and proposed a multi-mode attack model, BADUSB-C. This obtains UI status to make attacks more precise and effective. To the best of our knowledge, BADUSB-C is the first attack model utilizing USB Type-C. To validate the usability and effectiveness, we conducted extensive experiments to simulate daily usage and summarized the private information collected. We also discussed the recommended countermeasures for our attack model, including isolated UI rendering, which may be inspiring for future research on defense methods.},

  abstract = {Under the strong impact of the Internet, the operation of traditional shopping malls has become more and more difficult and urgently needs to be reformed. What can help the reform of shopping malls is the massive sales data generated in the long-term operation. However, because the cashier systems of merchants are independent of each other, it is difficult for shopping malls to acquire and audit the sales data reported by merchants in a unified manner. Therefore, a printer data senseless acquisition device is designed and completed. Subsequently shopping malls can use the merchant sales data acquired by the device to collect rent and optimize the types of merchants. In this paper, without affecting any function and printing process of the cash register printer, a data acquisition device is connected in series between the cash register and the printer. The device is plug and play, compatible with USB ports and serial port micro printers. For a cash register, the device is simulated as a printer; for a printer, the device is simulated as a cash register, which completes adaptive simulation (without configuration) and transparent transmission functions and can realize network data transmission or SD card temporary storage.},

Virtualization has been used as an enabler for safety and security, but research works have proven that it must be extended and improved with hardware-based security foundations. ARM Trustzone has been used for the realization of Trusted Environments, however in this case real-time requirements are completely disregarded. This work in progress paper presents FreeTEE, an embedded architecture that emphasizes and preserves the real-time properties of the system but still guarantees security from the outset. TrustZone technology is exploited to implement the basic building blocks of a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) as a lower-priority thread of a RTOS.

DENSO is a leading supplier of advanced automotive technology, systems and components for major automakers. All electronic components are encapsulated in mold to protect internal structure of external damages compound. The automatic decapsulation system takes an integrated circuit encapsulated in mold compound and removes it using a user-specified chemical solution.  The main objective of this processing at automotive industry consists in detect and seen semiconductor failure analysis. In the automatic decap user can modify the etch parameters (etching temperature, etching time, acid mixture…) depending sample measures and material composition.  The target of this project is to make experimental tests with different electronic components to create an optimal decapsulation handbook, for in the future only seeing the component user will be able to select the correct etching program, and study the effect of acids over bonding wires(connections between chip surfaces and terminals in a component) when the material used as copper.  During the study engineer will understand semiconductors materials fabrication, internal packaging structure, chemicals usage for decapsulation and rinse, safety operations in the laboratory and analysis techniques.  Trial and error method will be used to establish the best etching conditions. A total of 10 decapsulation programs are created for different electronic components (integrated circuits and transistors) during this project.  For the study of acids effects in copper material, the automatic decapsulation machine presents, Bias Voltage (method create to protect copper). Different voltages will be tested in this project in order to establish a good value for in the future protect the copper wires.

  abstract = {Point of Sale (POS) systems has become the technology of choice for most businesses and offering number of advantages over traditional cash registers. They manage staffs, customers, transaction, inventory, sale and labor reporting, price adjustment, as well as keeping track of cash flow, expense management, reducing human errors and more. Whether traditional on-premise POS, or Cloud-Bases POS, they help businesses to run more efficiently. However, despite all these advantages, POS systems are becoming targets of a number of cyber-attacks. Security of a POS system is a key requirement of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). This paper undertakes research into the PCI DSS and its accompanying standards, in an attempt to break or bypass security measures using varying degrees of vulnerability and penetration attacks in a methodological format. The resounding goal of this experimentation is to achieve a basis from which attacks can be made against a realistic networking environment from whence an intruder can bypass security measures thus exposing a vulnerability in the PCI DSS and potentially exposing confidential customer payment information.},

Owing to the increase in the usage of payment cards, especially in online purchases, fraud cases are on the rise. The rise creates financial risk and uncertainty, as in the commercial sector, it incurs billions of losses each year. However, real transaction records that can facilitate the development of effective predictive models for fraud detection are difficult to obtain, mainly because of issues related to confidentially of customer information. In this paper, we apply a total of 13 statistical and machine learning models for payment card fraud detection using both publicly available and real transaction records. The results from both original features and aggregated features are analyzed and compared. A statistical hypothesis test is conducted to evaluate whether the aggregated features identified by a genetic algorithm can offer a better discriminative power, as compared with the original features, in fraud detection. The outcomes positively ascertain the effectiveness of using aggregated features for undertaking real-world payment card fraud detection problems.},

  abstract = {Universal serial bus (USB) is rapidly replacing the serial port on personal computers (PC). It provides high speed flexible interconnectivity between a PC and its peripherals. It is a low cost solution which supports data transfer rates up to 12 Mbps (USB 1.0) and 480 Mbps (USB 2.0). It also provides 5V supply to the peripheral device. High level of emission was observed in the power supply wires of the USB while a satellite receiver (peripheral) was evaluated for its functionality. On analysis, it was observed that emission from USB can affect the performance of the peripheral unit depending on the sensitivity of peripheral device to the power supply spurious noise. In this paper, the emissions from a typical PC and methods towards improvement of the emissions are analysed. Precautions to be taken whenever any peripheral device is evaluated, for EMI performance, are discussed. USB, even though a powerful interface, should be carefully used for an overall performance of the system in which it is utilized.},

  abstract = {USB attacks are becoming more sophisticated. Rather than using USB devices solely as a delivery mechanism for host-side exploits, attackers are targeting the USB stack itself, embedding malicious code in device firmware to covertly request additional USB interfaces, providing unacknowledged and malicious functionality that lies outside the apparent purpose of the device. This allows for attacks such as BadUSB, where a USB storage device with malicious firmware is capable of covertly acting as a keyboard as well, allowing it to inject malicious scripts into the host machine. We observe that the root cause of such attacks is that the USB Stack exposes a set of unrestricted device privileges and note that the most reliable information about a device's capabilities comes from the end user's expectation of the device's functionality. We design and implement GoodUSB, a mediation architecture for the Linux USB Stack. We defend against BadUSB attacks by enforcing permissions based on user expectations of device functionality. GoodUSB includes a security image component to simplify use, and a honeypot mechanism for observing suspicious USB activities. GoodUSB introduces only 5.2\% performance overhead compared to the unmodified Linux USB subsystem. It is an important step forward in defending against USB attacks and towards allowing the safe deployment of USB devices in the enterprise.},

  abstract = {USB-based attacks have increased in complexity in recent years. Modern attacks now incorporate a wide range of attack vectors, from social engineering to signal injection. To address these challenges, the security community has responded with a growing set of fragmented defenses. In this work, we survey and categorize USB attacks and defenses, unifying observations from both peer-reviewed research and industry. Our systematization extracts offensive and defensive primitives that operate across layers of communication within the USB ecosystem. Based on our taxonomy, we discover that USB attacks often abuse the trust-by-default nature of the ecosystem, and transcend different layers within a software stack; none of the existing defenses provide a complete solution, and solutions expanding multiple layers are most effective. We then develop the first formal verification of the recently released USB Type-C Authentication specification, and uncover fundamental flaws in the specification's design. Based on the findings from our systematization, we observe that while the spec has successfully pinpointed an urgent need to solve the USB security problem, its flaws render these goals unattainable. We conclude by outlining future research directions to ensure a safer computing experience with USB.},

Although mobile payment has gained its popularity in many regions due to its convenience, it also faces many threats and security challenges. In this paper, we present a mobile payment processing model and introduce each type of mobile payment systems. We summarize the security services desired in mobile payment systems and also the security mechanisms which are currently in place. We further identify and discuss three security threats, i.e., malware, SSL/TLS vulnerabilities, and data breaches, and four security challenges, i.e., malware detection, multi-factor authentication, data breach prevention, and fraud detection and prevention, in mobile payment systems.},
