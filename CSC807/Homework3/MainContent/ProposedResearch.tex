\section{Research Objectives }
Section Outline:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The goal of the research is to get an idea of what the potential "threat map" looks like.
  \item With the technical "specs" for the hardware and OS, can we manipulate device capabilities?
  \item What capabilities can we extend or add?
\end{itemize}

\section{Research Questions/Hypotheses}
Section Outline:
\begin{itemize}
  \item What is the baseline or minimum hardware these devices are running?
  \item What software is being used on these devices? OS, libraries...
  \item Can the software/firmware be modified?
  \item If so, how much can be modified? In memory? Reflashed?
  \item Given hardware baseline, what does that performance support? Intended functions plus a webserver?
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
Likely, but not limited to the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Gather recent research within the last 5-10 years for manufacturer/device shares of the market
  \item Gather technical sheets and specs for the most popular devices
  \item Take note of the hardware specs for each device as well as firmware used
  \item Create default/debug images of each popular devices' firmware - what is natively supported?
  \item Is there room to add functionality without crippling original function
\end{itemize}
