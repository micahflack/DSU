Lockwood's three standards ratings:
\begin{itemize}
  \item intellectually original [0 - 5] ... (4): I think the research goals and proposed research are novel in terms of their contributions and application of existing research. It's important to take research, see where it can be applied and then actually prove that it can be. With this project it is more than taking an exactly replicable idea and tossing it at an undocumented piece of hardware. It will require significant research and development time.

  \item technically substantial [0 - 5] ... (3): Again, the ideas are out there and have been used similarly. But they have not been used for this type of device nor type of platform. The exact definitions for how this differentiates from previous works could use some massaging to prevent confusion.

  \item socially constructive [0 - 5] ... (3): Similar to the second standard, finding the exact wording to stress the significance and utility of the work is required. Regardless, these devices are seen everywhere and not just on PoS systems. They can be found on critical infrastructure and industrial control systems or human-machine interfaces where paper reporting is used. Assessment and then creation of a proof-of-concept as future work would, in my eyes, be a novel contribution.
